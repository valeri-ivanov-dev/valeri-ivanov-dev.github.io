            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio. I am a full stack developer with extensive experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications. My expertise spans both frontend and backend technologies, ensuring seamless integration and performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the frontend, I have a strong proficiency in Angular and React.js, crafting interactive and user-friendly interfaces. These frameworks enable me to deliver robust and maintainable code that enhances user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                My backend skills are centered around Spring Boot and Microservices architecture, where I design and implement scalable and efficient backend solutions. This includes developing RESTful APIs, ensuring security, and optimizing performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am well-versed in database management with hands-on experience in PostgreSQL and MongoDB. My projects often leverage these databases for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management, ensuring data integrity and availability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I have substantial experience with Docker, enabling containerization of applications for consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages.
            </p>
            <p>
S                My cloud experience includes deploying and managing applications on AWS and Google Cloud. I utilize cloud services to enhance application scalability, reliability, and performance, leveraging the full potential of cloud computing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking to the future, I am planning to expand my skill set by integrating TensorFlow Java for machine learning applications, Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming, and Spring Cloud frameworks for building distributed systems and microservices. These technologies will further enhance my ability to develop cutting-edge solutions and stay at the forefront of technological advancements.
            </p>
